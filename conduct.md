All participants in the *Methodological Advances in Reticulate Evolution* workshop will adhere to the [code of conduct](https://2022.botanyconference.org/file.php?file=SiteAssets/2022_code_of_conduct.pdf) developed for the Botany 2023 conference.

Additionally, phylogenetic networks can invoke strong emotions as many of the best practices and evidence for introgression or gene flow in the history of some groups remains contentious. All members of the group with respect and engage in discussion and debate from a place of sincerity. We are committed to cooperative dialogue among individuals, based on asking and answering questions.
